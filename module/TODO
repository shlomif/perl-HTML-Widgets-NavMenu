* Write some tests with a selective 'expand' directive that expands in one
path and doesn't expand in others.

* Make the syntax of the navigation menus more sane ("label" or "text" 
instead of "value", etc.) That would break compatibility.

* Write the predicate class and assign it to 'expand' and possibly other
places where it's appropriate.

* Restore the abs_url directive only as url_type or whatever.
    - Add a url_type accessor to LeadingPath::Component.

* Add an option to link to the pages as:

1. By relative URLs. (../../../hello/world/yes.html)

2. By site-abs URLs (/hoola/hello/world/yes.html)

3. By fully qualified URLs (http://www.mysite.org/hoola/hello/world/yes.html)

* Write full documentation for the module.

Long-Term:
----------

* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
    - like id=""

* Add a host-based regexp arbitrator to the predicate:
    { 'host_re' => { 't2' => "^home/", 'vipe' => "^home2/" } }
