* Possibly do something about:
     my $host = $sub_contents->{host} || $args{host} or
        die "Host not specified!";

     In create_new_nav_menu_item, and in
     render_tree_contents.

        - Done.

Long-Term:
----------

* Use HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node and its accessors for the rest
  of the $ptr->{text} etc. manipulations.

* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
    - like id=""

* Add a host-based regexp arbitrator to the predicate:
    { 'host_re' => { 't2' => "^home/", 'vipe' => "^home2/" } }

* Write more tests with a selective 'expand' directive that expands in one
path and doesn't expand in others.
    - test more expand types.

* In HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node - make sure url_type accepts only
its enum values.
