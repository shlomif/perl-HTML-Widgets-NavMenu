* Release on CPAN as version 0.4.0.
    - change the version in $VERSION.
    - document the changes in Changes.
    - update the readme.

Long-Term:
----------

* Use HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node and its accessors for the rest
  of the $ptr->{text} etc. manipulations.
    - for the get_next_coords() and friends functions.

* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
    - like id=""

* Add a host-based regexp arbitrator to the predicate:
    { 'host_re' => { 't2' => "^home/", 'vipe' => "^home2/" } }

* In HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node - make sure url_type accepts only
its enum values.

* Future direction: generate the tree once and then be able to render
it for different path_info()/current_host() configurations. (and the
generated tree re-used by all other members).

* Refactor get_next_coords().

* Create a base class for classes with 'subs' functionality - like 
get_nth_sub, add_sub, num_subs, etc. Both ..::Node and ..::Item share it.

* Eliminate the use of the CGI module, by providing my own alternative for
CGI::escapeHTML().
