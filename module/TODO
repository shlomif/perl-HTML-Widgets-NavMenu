Long-Term:
----------

* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
    - like id=""

* Add a host-based regexp arbitrator to the predicate:
    { 'host_re' => { 't2' => "^home/", 'vipe' => "^home2/" } }

* In HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node - make sure url_type accepts only
its enum values.

* Give an option to render a sub-set of the navigation-menu, starting
at a certain coords/url-path.

* Release on CPAN as version 0.8.0.
   - change the version in $VERSION.
   - document the changes in Changes.
   - update the readme.
