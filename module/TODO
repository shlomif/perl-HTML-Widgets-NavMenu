* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make 'expand_always', 'expand_cb' directives.

* Eliminate the hard-coded class="navbarnested", etc. directives by making
the code more modular.

* Eliminate the specified dealing with the header role by putting it in
a derived class.

* Restore the abs_url directive only as use_abs_url or whatever.

* Add an option to link to the pages as:

1. By relative URLs. (../../../hello/world/yes.html)

2. By site-abs URLs (/hoola/hello/world/yes.html)

3. By fully qualified URLs (http://www.mysite.org/hoola/hello/world/yes.html)

* Write the "SEE ALSO" section of the POD document. (cover the other
similar modules)

* Write full documentation for the module.

Long-Term:
----------

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
