* Write tests to test the url_type and rec_url_type of the leading path,
and site map.

* Use HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node and its accessors for the rest
  of the $ptr->{text} etc. manipulations.

* Encapsulate the predicate call within its own re-usable (and over-ridable)
function.

* Write full documentation for the module.

Long-Term:
----------

* Write a unit-test for HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::get_cross_host_rel_url().

* Use Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL. (?)

* Make the module support URLs with CGI GET parameters properly.

* Add support for more attributes other than class="" to the ul and li
tags.
    - like id=""

* Add a host-based regexp arbitrator to the predicate:
    { 'host_re' => { 't2' => "^home/", 'vipe' => "^home2/" } }

* Write more tests with a selective 'expand' directive that expands in one
path and doesn't expand in others.
    - test more expand types.

* In HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Tree::Node - make sure url_type accepts only
its enum values.
