    - Add HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::JQueryTreeView for generating navigation
    menu that this jQuery plugin can handle well:
        - http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/

1.0501    Sun Nov 14 12:11:19 IST 2010
    - Now generating the Makefile.PL from the Build.PL using
    create_makefile_pl (less error-prone).

1.0500    Fri Nov 12 20:43:08 IST 2010
    - Convert from Class::Accessor to Class::XSAccessor for extra speed.
    - Add the tag-release.pl file.

1.0400    Wed Dec  9 11:44:05 IST 2009
    - Got rid of the dependency on Error.pm.
    - moved the HTML/ directory with the test scripts-support code from
    the root of the distribution to unde t/lib .

1.0302    Thu Jun 25 16:48:42 IDT 2009
    - Fixed some broken links and other inaccuracies in the POD of
    lib/HTML/Widgets/NavMenu.pm .

1.0301    Tue Jun 23 23:01:54 IDT 2009
    - Changed the 'license' in Build.PL from "bsd" to the more accurate
    "mit".
    - Added keywords and links to the META.yml.

1.0300    Sun Jun 14 13:57:09 IDT 2009
    - Refactoring: Made HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Object a sub-class of
    Class::Accessor to remove many "use base" calls to it.
    - In progress - converting a flat %args hash (splatted into the @_)
    into a single $args hash-ref.
    - Removed a use lib "." from HTML::Widgets::NavMenu - it's a leftover
    statement that could be a subtle bug.
    - Refactoring: converted direct $self->{'field'} accesses to
    accessors. (from all the classes).
    - Fixed a bug with the HeaderRole where an empty <ul> was created.

1.0201    Fri Mar 28 17:46:59 IDT 2008
    - Fixed a case where a non-capturing expand in a node inside a
    capturing expand caused the upper node to be non-capturing too.

1.0200    Sun Mar 23 21:53:37 IST 2008
    - Removed trailing whitespace from "# TEST" lines - this can confuse
    early versions of Test-Count
    - Fixed a "# TEST" instead of a "# TESTbr" line that confused Test-Count.
    - Added the no_leading_dot option with a test.

1.0100    Fri Feb  8 19:19:09 IST 2008
    - Fixed a bug in HTML::Widgets::NavMenu::Url:
    relative URL from a non-dir to a dir. It accidently had an
    extraneous "../".
    - Fixed the _get_leading_path_of_coords function in HTML::Widgets::NavMenu
    to properly generate the topmost item of the breadcrumbs trail, which
    should be in coords = [0] and not coord = []. The latter is meaningless
    and ignored. This caused a subtle bug in combining the breadcrumbs
    trails of my homesite.
        - it became apparent when the URL of the [0] item was not empty.
    - Added the 'capt' key to the 'expand' => keys for "capturing" regex.

1.0001    Mon Sep 11 14:38:39 IDT 2006
    - Added "use strict" and "use warnings" to all modules.
    - Added a Test::Pod based test.
    - Added a Test::Pod::Coverage test, and added POD to all modules.
        - Some internal methods were prefixed with an underscore.
    - Added the examples directory.

1.0000    Sun Nov 06 16:01:00 IST 2005
    - Made sure that the breadcrumbs trail in expanded sections will
    display the components of the expanded sections.
    - Fixed the POD.
    - Added the link to the article to the POD.
    - Bumped the major version number to 1.x and kept some digits into the
    future to make CPAN and CPAN.pm happy.

0.10.2    Wed Aug 24 20:37:55 IST 2005
    (backdated - module was released on 17-August-2005)
    - Added IO::Scalar to the Perl modules this module depends on. (it
    is needed by the tests, but was not explicitly specified yet, because
    it was believed to be part of the core distribution).

0.10.1    Mon Jul 25 17:19:05 IST 2005
    - Fixed the building using "perl Makefile.PL" and "make".

0.10.0    Tue Jul 12 20:45:40 IST 2005
