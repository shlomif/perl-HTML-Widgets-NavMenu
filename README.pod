=head1 HTML-Widgets-NavMenu

HTML::Widgets::NavMenu generates a navigation menu for a site. It can also
generate a complete site map, a path of leading components, and also keeps
track of navigation links ("Next", "Prev", "Up", etc.)

It accepts as input a nested tree with the input for the various nodes in
the site, and generates the HTML as output. It has a detailed API documentation
in the embedded POD, and many examples in the tests and in sites created
by the author. Currently, it lacks developer's and extender's information,
but hopefully one can find his way around the code easily enough.

HTML::Widgets::NavMenu is covered by many automated tests.

It can be found under the C<module> sub-directory.
